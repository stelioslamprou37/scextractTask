task: >
  You are provided with a PBMC scRNA-seq dataset. Use the scExtract pipeline
  to process the data and answer the following questions:

questions:
  - id: q1
    stage: quality_control
    text: "What percentage of reads passed quality control in FastQC?"
    answer_type: numeric_percent
    tolerance: 0.5

  - id: q2
    stage: alignment
    text: "How many reads were uniquely aligned to the genome?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q3
    stage: quantification
    text: "How many genes were detected in the top cell barcode?"
    answer_type: integer_exact

  - id: q4
    stage: annotation
    text: "Which cell type was most abundant after annotation?"
    answer_type: string_exact

  - id: q5
    stage: clustering
    text: "How many cell clusters were identified?"
    answer_type: integer_exact
